-- Manhattan distance (definition)

-- Definition: The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. 

--  happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
--  happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
--  happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
--  happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
-- Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.
